## Beautiful word clouds with jQuery

jQCloud is a jQuery plugin that builds neat and pure HTML + CSS word clouds and tag clouds that are actually shaped like a cloud (otherwise, why would we call them 'word clouds'?).

Also available as [AngularJS directive](https://github.com/mistic100/angular-jqcloud)
